> *Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to **(multi-)Paxos**, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for build- ing practical systems. In order to enhance understandabil- ity, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as **leader election, log replication, and safety,** and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majori- ties to guarantee safety.*
> > #### NOTES:
> > 1. raft等效于multi-paxos。
> > 2. raft一直协议由多个独立的部分组成：**选主**、**日志复制**和**安全**。

> **Strong leader:** Raft uses a stronger form of leader- ship than other consensus algorithms. For example, log entries only flow from the leader to other servers. This simplifies the management of the replicated log and makes Raft easier to understand.
> > #### NOTE:
> > 1.日志只能从主机拷贝到备机。（和Paxos有什么区别？）

> **Leader election:** Raft uses randomized timers to elect leaders. This adds only a small amount of mechanism to the heartbeats already required for any consensus algorithm, while resolving conflicts sim- ply and rapidly.
> #### NOTES:
> > 1.通过简单改造心跳协议，raft采用了随机计时器来选注，从而可以快速简单的坚决选注冲突的问题。
